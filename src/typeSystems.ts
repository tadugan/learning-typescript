// What is type checking?
// Answering a question about type equivalence

let x: number;

let y: string = 'Hello';

console.log(y);

// x = y; This will throw an error when compiling, because x must be a number.

// Type systems
// Static type systems have you declare types in your code
// Dynamic type systems perform their type equivalence check at runtime.

// Nominal Type systems
// nominal type systems are all about names

// Structural type systems
// Structural type systems are all about shape

// Duck typing
// “If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quack like a duck, then it probably is a duck”.
